# Python packages required by the GUI tools in this folder
# Install with: pip install -r requirements

# For yay_gui.py (Qt-based GUI)
PyQt5

# Note: tkinter-based tools (btd_gui.py, cachy_updater_gui.py,
# givemebadge_gui.py, gpu-recorder-control.py) use the standard
# library tkinter module. On some systems you may need to install
# system packages (e.g. python3-tk / tk) instead of pip packages.
